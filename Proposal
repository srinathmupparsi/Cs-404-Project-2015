Wireless Car
Semester Project 2015
Team 09  	                        
Date: 22nd Oct 2015

Executive Summary
Our main aim is to create a wireless car using motors and beagle bone and also Raspberry pi.  
The gpio pins are used to control the motor on the car to remote it. We will connect to our server to control directions using server-client method. Some additional interfaces, such as a IR sensor to control the moving direction of the car, an analog input to control the speed of the car and we will connect the pi/beagle bone to internet to control the car remotely ,control the motor speed ,are considered to be done based on the progress of the project.
